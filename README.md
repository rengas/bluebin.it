# Why? 
Singapore's blue bins are often misused due to "wishcycling" â€“ tossing items in with the hope they're recyclable, even when they're not.
This leads to contamination and wasted efforts. This simple web app helps you know for sure what belongs in the blue bin, so you can recycle 
right and make a real difference.

# How? 
A household item image classifier was built using [Teachablemachine ](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to determine whether items should be discarded as trash or recycled in the blue bin.
